Here's a simplified **layman-friendly report** based on the detailed technical explanation you provided:

# **Understanding the Windows API: A Layman’s Guide**

## **What is the Windows API?**

The **Windows API (Application Programming Interface)** is like a **toolbox** that Microsoft provides so software programs can **talk to the Windows operating system**. This toolbox includes functions that allow programs to do things like open files, display windows, use memory, and more — **without breaking security rules**.

Think of it like a **reception desk** at a company — if you want something from the back office (the Windows system), you go through the desk (the API), not directly into the office (kernel).

## **Goals of the Windows API**

1. **Avoid direct hardware access:** Keeps programs from tampering with sensitive parts of your computer.
2. **Provide services:** Helps software do things like read files or show messages.
3. **Compatibility:** Makes sure programs work even on newer versions of Windows.
4. **Consistency:** Keeps the way developers write programs predictable.

## **Two Main Types of APIs**

### 1. **User-Mode APIs**

These are the everyday functions used by most applications. They live in libraries like:

* `kernel32.dll`
* `user32.dll`
* `advapi32.dll`

They allow apps to open files, create windows, or manage memory.

### 2. **Native APIs (NT APIs)**

These are deeper-level functions, hidden under the hood. They’re found in:

* `ntdll.dll`
  They have names like `NtOpenProcess` or `ZwCreateFile`. These are **more direct and powerful**, often used by hackers or advanced tools to avoid being noticed by antivirus software.

## **User Mode vs Kernel Mode (The Two Worlds of Windows)**

| **User Mode**                  | **Kernel Mode**                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Limited access                 | Full control of system                  |
| Safe to run apps               | Dangerous if misused                    |
| Crashes don't affect Windows   | Crash causes Blue Screen (BSOD)         |
| Uses functions like CreateFile | Uses deeper functions like NtCreateFile |

Understanding this difference is important in cybersecurity, especially for **Red Teamers** (ethical hackers) who try to avoid being detected by security tools.

## **API Layers – How Deep Do You Want to Go?**

### 1. **Win32 API (Top Layer)**

* Easy to use
* Examples: `CreateFile`, `OpenProcess`
* Found in `kernel32.dll`, `user32.dll`

### 2. **NT API (Deeper Layer)**

* Lower-level
* Examples: `NtOpenProcess`
* Found in `ntdll.dll`
* Often used to **sneak past security software**

### 3. **Syscalls (Core Layer)**

* These are the **secret signals** that jump directly to the system’s core.
* They are very hard to detect and used in advanced evasion.
* Usually used through **assembly code** or **shellcode** (raw computer instructions).

## **Understanding Nt, Zw, and Prefixes in Kernel Land**

Each part of Windows uses a naming system to group functions:

| **Prefix** | **Means**              | **Example**            | **What It Does**                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Cm`       | Configuration Manager  | `CmRegisterCallbackEx` | Handles Registry settings                        |
| `Ex`       | Executive Layer        | `ExAllocatePool`       | Core system helpers like memory handling         |
| `Io`       | I/O Manager            | `IoAllocateIrp`        | Device input/output operations                   |
| `Ke`       | Kernel Core            | `KeSetEvent`           | Scheduling, event signaling                      |
| `Mm`       | Memory Manager         | `MmUnlockPages`        | Controls virtual and physical memory             |
| `Ob`       | Object Manager         | `ObReferenceObject`    | Deals with system objects like files and handles |
| `Nt`       | Native API (User-mode) | `NtCreateFile`         | Direct access to system services from user mode  |
| `Zw`       | Kernel-mode API        | `ZwCreateFile`         | Similar to Nt, but used from inside the system   |

---

### **Nt vs Zw Functions**

| **Nt Functions**         | **Zw Functions**              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Used by normal programs  | Used internally by Windows    |
| Go through normal checks | Might bypass some checks      |
| Return raw error codes   | May return simplified results |

**Note**: Sometimes they both point to the same code, but behave differently depending on where they’re called from.

## **Important DLLs to Know**

| **DLL Name**   | **What It’s Used For**                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `kernel32.dll` | High-level stuff like files and threads  |
| `ntdll.dll`    | Deeper system functions and syscalls     |
| `user32.dll`   | Handles windows, buttons, and user input |
| `advapi32.dll` | Registry access, security, encryption    |
| `gdi32.dll`    | Graphics, fonts, and drawing             |

## **Why Hackers and Red Teams Care**

Security tools (like EDRs — Endpoint Detection & Response) **often monitor** the higher-level functions in user mode, especially in `ntdll.dll`.
To **avoid being seen**, skilled attackers:

* Use direct syscalls
* Restore or unhook `ntdll.dll`
* Use `Nt*` or `Zw*` functions directly

---

## **Summary**

* **Windows APIs** are how programs interact with Windows safely and consistently.
* There are different **layers**: from easy (Win32) to deep (Syscalls).
* Knowing the difference between **User Mode and Kernel Mode** helps you understand how Windows keeps things safe.
* **Red Teamers and hackers** use the lower-level APIs to stay undetected.
* Future tools and techniques can use these concepts to **evade detection** by going under the radar.
